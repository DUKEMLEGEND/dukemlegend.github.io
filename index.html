    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> No I don't
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> Then I have stopped texting her ever
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> PTT-20210819-WA0000.opus (file attached)
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> U are the girl I love ❤️💖 now,
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> I did the day I decided to love you
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> I already did and I am moving on with you
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> Nilikuwa nimemdanganya I wanted to say sorry
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> Did you know I am unable to sleep and all that because of you,
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> U just broke up with me over text and at night when I am asleep.....
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> Did you know I am unable to sleep and all that because of you,
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> Nimeamka to check if my phone is charging only to find long massages on how I still love jnny......
     <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> The worst part is u broke up with me over a text, tena usiku, surely who does that? Did u know what it will do to me......
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> At the same time I only told you to call Jane bcz nilimkosea so bad so I wanted to say sorry in away that she will not think that I am desperate
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> ... desperate....for her....
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> And my status was meant for her yes I admit that but it wasn't something personal, thats bcz I found something about her so I was like what!... I wanted to tell someone.... But I couldn't tell my best friend Fred or u my gf bcz in any way u all could have said something that I couldn't like
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> But if you feel that I should be alone I will respect u decision, although I am not fine with it ...... I guess 🤔 I will never fall in love again not at this age .....
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> I know what you are thinking...... If I truly love you I should fight 💖🌹 for ur love..... And say I am sorry so that things can go back to normal.....
    But I won't do that coz I know......
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> ..... I know u already have someone..... U always had someone....all along.... But that doesn't bother me.....
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> ....Bcz nimezoe kuachwa.....
    <br><h1>Çöñvërtêd</h1><p> One thing you should know.... Yes I still love Jannie....but I will never be with her.... Even if she was the last woman on earth 🌍... I wouldn't be with her....Reasons u already know them.....I love Jannie.... But I love ❤️💖🥰💕 you more
